The objective of this work is to value the invention patent of Integrated Alcuza System design: INAPI registration N $^{o}$ 50.295 (10/22/2009). The owner of this is Mr. Rodrigo Stuardo. In order to value a patent, different methodologies can be applied, in particular, in the present report, it goes deeper into the NPV method. Under this context, the project will be evaluated in a way such as to assume that a company already exists with the capabilities to invest and develop the product that can be generated from the patent, that is, an integrated cruet system. The product is then generated from the client's invention patent.

The mentioned company plays the role of a potential patent purchaser, who is interested in using the design to expand its business. This business has been restricted to operate outsourcing its production, it stores and produces the product. The novelty value and the restricted segment of the product generated are the challenging factors that represent the irreversibility of the project. However, the attractiveness and functional novelty of the device are competitive advantages whose impact on the market is evaluated through demand.

Two methodologies were used to estimate the annual demand. In the first one, the annual percentage of families that bought a cruet was obtained, this value was 28 \% and the market share of the integrated cruet was determined to be 0.7 \%. These data were determined on the basis of information from the 2002 CENSO, general public surveys, interviews with commercial stores and store catalog information available on the internet. In the second methodology, the Bass model was used to estimate demand. In both methods, the product life cycle was considered, which lasted for 3 years and the methodologies were extended to all Chile.

Based on prices of non-traditional cruet and the financial status of a retail store, the market price of the integrated cruet was determined to be \$ 9,356. The quantity offered was determined as an approximation of the total demand in the 3 years.

The costs incurred by the company are initially to develop a product from a design. Subsequently, the production costs are added, mainly given by the glassware that manufactures the warehouse, storage costs, given by the warehouse company, shipping costs, transport company and dispatch.

The NPV of the project is negative with the first methodology of estimation of demand and positive for the second methodology. For the base case, which consists in not performing any action it is equals zero.

Three sensitivity analyzes were carried out: the discount rate, the market share of the product developed from the Cruet Integrated System for the first methodology of estimation of demand, and the price of the product for both methodologies.
